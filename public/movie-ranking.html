 <h1>The Best Movies According To Danielle</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 moves of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
 <p>One of my most loved movies because not only do I love the message of the movies but wolves are also my favourite animal.</p>
 <h3>The Imitation Game</h3>
 <p>Amazing depiction of the creation of the computer during the war and the injustices Alan Turing faced despite his huge steps in bringing humanity into its next stage.</p>
 <h3>Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>
 <p>Need I say more? Amazing movie, amazing acting. Not for nothing it would run on loop while I was studying at university!</p>
